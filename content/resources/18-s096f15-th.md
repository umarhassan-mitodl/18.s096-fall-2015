description: 'Given noisy rotated copies of an image (corresponding to vertices of
  the depicted graph), the goal is to estimate the original image (or answer: who
  is in this picture?). Before averaging the images to denoise them, one has to estimate
  the unknown rotations they were subject to. By comparing some pairs of images (corresponding
  to edges of the depicted graph), it is possible to estimate the relative rotations
  between them. The problem of recovering the rotation of each image from these relative
  rotation estimates is an instance of Angular Synchronization. Image by Dr. Afonso
  Bandeira.'
